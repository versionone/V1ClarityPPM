The process begins by reading the date of the most recent actual that has been integrated from from a file in the directory configured by the $output macro. If the date is not read correctly the process will log an error message and exit. Once the date is read, the subprocess `p_GetDateRange_VersionOne` uses it to query VersionOne to find the minimum and maximum dates of the actuals that will be integrated, and stores these dates in macros. If there are no new actuals found then the process terminates. Once the dates are found, the process reads the new actuals from VersionOne and stores them in memory, then reads the existing TimePeriods from Clarity PPM that cover the date range that were found in the previous step. Then it iterates through the Clarity PPM actuals and adds all incoming values to the appropriate day. If it does not insert any new actuals, the process logs a message and exits. Finally, the updated TimePeriods are sent to Clarity PPM.</description><keywords></keywords><createdBy id="1000">ibuchanan</createdBy><createdDate>2013-01-28T10:40:05.661-05:00</createdDate><updatedBy id="1">super</updatedBy><updatedDate>2013-02-13T16:27:01.994-05:00</updatedDate></metadata>
