When you configure the integration for the first time, you will want to reconcile the projects manually. Depending on the usage patterns across the tools, the reconciliation spreadsheet may have many uses:
* If you are configuring the products for the first time, it may indicate a project you need to update with a reference.
* If you are diagnosing a problem with timesheets, time logged in that project won't be connected to Clarity PPM.
* If you are auditing the agile project portfolio, it may indicate planning that senior management hasn't approved.</description><keywords></keywords><createdBy id="1000">ibuchanan</createdBy><createdDate>2013-01-28T10:40:05.661-05:00</createdDate><updatedBy id="1000">ibuchanan</updatedBy><updatedDate>2013-01-28T11:03:52.848-05:00</updatedDate></metadata>
