There are no user synchronization processes in this integration; therefore, users in each system are mapped by the convention that VersionOne email address matches the Clarity PPM ID. Since both fields can be hand-edited so there is the possibility of error. Reconciling resources is helpful to correct errors and to troubleshoot the integration.</description><keywords></keywords><createdBy id="1000">ibuchanan</createdBy><createdDate>2013-01-28T10:40:05.661-05:00</createdDate><updatedBy id="1000">ibuchanan</updatedBy><updatedDate>2013-01-28T11:04:19.323-05:00</updatedDate></metadata>
